# codilityBinaryGap
The Binary Gap test from Codility. Question, and solution given in readme and javascript file.


This app will search through binary code (for example the number 9 = '1001') then returns the value of the longest sequence of 0's so in the case of number 9, this 
value would be 2. 

The number 529 has binary representation 1000010001 and contains two binary gaps: one of length 4 and one of length 3. This means that 4 should be output as it is the 
'largest' binary gap.
